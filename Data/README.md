# Raw data used in this manuscript

## Collinear_blocks
Fasta and gff files used for McScanX analysis. The gff files required for McScanX is not the "GFF*" files commonly used in genomics.

## Comparative_genomics
Fasta files used for Orthofinder and conservation analysis. Fasta files for (1) Diptera-level (2) Chironomida-level (3) _ab initio_ gene prediction are prepared.

## Variants
VCF files produced during variant analysis. The "initial_variant_analysis" directory containes files used for Pairwise nucleotide variance and Fst estimation. These files were analalyzed using the Pv5.0 genome (chr 1 and chr 3 are in reverse). The "consensus_tree_files_vcf" directory contains files used for consensus sequence production.
